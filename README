The Tiny App is a simple form that allows the user to select either Carmichael 
or Dewick and view the breakfast menu items offered at that location. The app 
requires the user to choose either Carmichael or Dewick, and if the user does not select either option then the app with state: "Sorry, you did select a dining option. Please choose a dining option." The app runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmellow). 

The Android Developers website, https://developer.android.com/index.html, was 
used to learn about the different widgets and how to have a fully functioning 
app. Ming's simple app example from class was also used to develop the 
application. 

Before building this app, I had never used Android Studio or developed a 
mobile app, so I learned a lot. I specifically learned how to use radio groups, 
radio buttons and regular buttons, as well as the importance of designing a 
layout before placing widgets. I also learned how to import an image from 
online or my computer through the drawable folder.
